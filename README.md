Important Commands

1. To run live server, use the public folder to be served up
2. To run babel commands, use: babel src/playground/es6-arrow-functions.js --out-file=public/scripts/app.js --presets=env,react --watch

Note: You can change the out-file to point to whichever file you want to run from.
