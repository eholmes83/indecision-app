# indecision-app

This is a repo for the React Udemy course I'm working through.
I've been working on multiple computers and I've FINALLY decided to use a central place to store files and assignments throughout the course.

Important Commands

1. To run live server, use the npm run dev-server
2. To run babel commands, use: babel src/playground/es6-arrow-functions.js --out-file=public/scripts/app.js --presets=env,react --watch
3. Use node version 12.22.12

Note: You can change the out-file to point to whichever file you want to run from.
